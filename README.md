# String Calculator Kata

### Name : Rupen Chitroda
### Applying for role : Full Stack Developer

## Description 
This repository contains the implementation of exercise mentioned at [osherove.com](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1). This program is developed in java using Test Driven Development Approach. 

## Implementation
For implementing unit testing, I've used Java's **junit** library which is used for writing and running tests. JUnit is an open-source testing framework for java. JUnit is one of the unit testing framework.JUnit provides annotations to identify test methods. I have created test cases in testCases.java in order to perform unit testing for string calculator kata.

Here I have used org.junit pacakage, which contains interfaces and classes which we will need to use methods like assertEqual, Assert and annotations like @Before, @Test.

Repo contains two folders, [main](https://github.com/rupenchitroda/incubyteStringCalc/tree/main/main/java) folder consists logic for calculator's add function and the [test](https://github.com/rupenchitroda/incubyteStringCalc/tree/main/test/java) folder consists of test cases which are tested during development of this program.
